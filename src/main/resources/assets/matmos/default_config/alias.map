# This file contains comma-separated alias mappings like:
#
# torch=SomeCoolMod.cool_torch,SomeOtherMod.other_torch
# sword=SomeCoolMod.cool_sword,SomeOtherMod.other_sword
#
# Block/item names on the right side of the mapping will be counted as if they
# were blocks/items on the left side, with the exception of blocks/items that
# are mentioned in an expansion.
# (So if an expansion had a different sound for the cool_torch, it wouldn't get
# dealiased as the torch.)
#
# You can also import other alias files like this:
# :import some_other_file.map
#
# Tip: restart MAtmos to reload the aliases without having to restart Minecraft

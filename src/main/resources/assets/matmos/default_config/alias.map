# This file contains comma-separated alias mappings like:
#
# torch=SomeCoolMod.cool_torch,SomeOtherMod.other_torch
#
# Block names on the right side of the mapping will be counted as if they were 
# blocks on the left side, with the exception of blocks that are mentioned in
# an expansion.
# (So if an expansion had a different sound for the cool_torch, it wouldn't get
# dealiased as the torch.)
#
# Tip: restart MAtmos to reload the aliases without restarting Minecraft

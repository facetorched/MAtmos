* implement diamond shaped flood fill volumetric scan (32x32x32)
  * it refreshes when the player moves, or a block gets broken (or a door gets opened?)
  * it maintains a height map of top sunlit blocks around the player, ignoring leaves (and glass?)
  * implementation steps:
    * no leaf hack, refresh when the player moves
    * leaf hack
    * refresh when block is modified 
* implement diamond holed volumetric scan that relies on the former scan to scan the hole

things to check:
  can we check block modification events? [yes]
  
  can we check doors getting opened or closed? [yes]
  
  can one scanner add the counts of another scanner to itself? [seems doable]

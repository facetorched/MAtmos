    "1.12.2-34": "* New system for detecting when the player is outdoors, indoors, or deep indoors\n* A new soundpack making use of the new features: Matmos 2020 \"Zen\"\n* Update checking for sound packs\n* Versions are now also built for Forge\n* Made large_scanner more responsive\n* Many bug fixes and performance improvements",
    "1.12.2-34.1": "* Fixed crash when opening MAtmos menu with the ambient volume set to 0%\n* Updated SoundSystem for LiteLoader builds (fixes sounds occasionally going silent until the resource packs are reloaded)\n* Moved hint about reloading resource packs to the Advanced menu",
    "1.12.2-34.2": "+ Improved indoor scanning by raycast scanning through walls\n+ Moved F3+T hint back to menu\n+ LiteLoader: fixed SoundSystem not getting overridden\n\n* Fixed crashing or not getting detected when other Mixin mods are present\n* Fixed crash when profiler is opened while MAtmos is disabled\n* Fixed ScanAir.isTransparentToSound() logic",
    "1.12.2-35": "This is a port of 1.7.10-35 to 1.12.2.\n\nWARNING: this release changes the directory structure of the config files.\n\nIf you want to migrate your configs, follow the following steps\n(all paths are rooted in the .minecraft directory):\n\n  1. move /mods/matmos to /config/matmos\n  2. move /matmos to /config/matmos\n  3. rename /config/matmos/expansions_r29_userconfig to /config/expansions_userconfig\n\n\nAdditions:\n* Added system for playing sound effects when blocks are placed or broken\n\nConfig options:\n* Added block dealiasing. Blocks can be configured to count as other blocks, which can be used to add mod support to existing soundpacks globally.\n  (see /config/matmos/alias.map)\n* Added dimension whitelist/blacklist to make it configurable which dimensions ambience should/shouldn't play in\n* Made max block ID configurable via world.maxblockid (Fixes issue #2)\n* Added option to turn off suppressing vanilla rain sound (rain.suppress), and made the list of vanilla rain sounds configurable (so you can set rain sounds from other mods to suppress as well).\n* Made config options get hot reloaded when MAtmos is restarted\n\nChanges:\n* Moved config files to /config/matmos\n* Changed F3+T hint to F3+S\n\nFixes:\n* Fixed volume scroller (Hold the MAtmos key to adjust the volume)\n* Fixed block_contact being 1 block off\n* Fix crashing if start.enabled is set to false (Fixes issue #3)\n* Fixed NullPointerException when machine accesses a non-existent set\n* Fixed blocks with 0 metadata not getting counted\n\nSound engine changes:\n* Made streams not restart if multiple machines play the same stream, which makes fading the volume possible\n* Addded timed randoms with intervals 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 30s\n* Added can_rain_here to w_general. It's more accurate than can_biome_rain.\n* Added override_rain to meta_options. Its value is the same as rain.suppress. The soundpack shouldn't play its own rain if it's false.\n\n## Note about LiteLoader builds:\nI have made the decision to stop supporting LiteLoader, as it has become apparent that it's extra work that benefits few. \n\nHowever, the codebase still references the mod loader through an abstraction layer, so support for LiteLoader (or possibly even other mod loaders) could be easily implemented.\n\nAnyone is free to do so via a pull request on GitHub.",
    "1.12.2-35.1": "* Implemented my own sound manager to use for playing streamed sounds, instead of using Minecraft's buggy one. Streamed sound playback should be a lot more stable now (it had a bug that sometimes made sounds get stuck playing multiple times at once).\n* Reverted F3+S hint to F3+T (F3+S is not a thing in 1.12.2, and it did the same thing as F3+T in 1.7.10)"
